## Securing AWS Infrastructure with Trend Micro - Cloud One 
  
This hands-on lab is part of the **AWS Marketplace DevOps Workshop Series** :cloud: :laptop:. 

In this workshop, you’ll learn how to leverage infrastructure as code (IaC) and Security to automate your cloud security efforts. If you’re interested in making cloud security more efficient, automated, proactive, and accessible to developers, cloud architects, DevOps engineers this workshop is for you! 

Using **Trend Micro - Cloud One, AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodePipeline**, and **AWS Services**, you’ll get hands-on experience implementing an automated **CloudFormation** security and compliance workflow. 


Trend Micro - Cloud One is a **Cloud Security Platform** that enables all teams to safely deliver and protect the new applications and cloud environments through security features from our security platform.

**Trend Micro - Cloud One** is available in AWS Marketplace. AWS Marketplace is a digital software catalog that makes it easy to find, try, buy, deploy, and manage the software that runs on AWS. AWS Marketplace has a broad and deep selection of ISV solutions that can help you build your ideal DevOps toolchain in the cloud with agility, automation, and security.
